# Neovim configuration with Lua

A [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration using Lua, with the minimal number of pluggins I need for programming. Different language servers available through the LSP protocol provide code completion and analysis.

This readme exist so I don't have to remember how to do all these things when setting up a new machine.

## Installation for Mac OSX

* Install `nvim`, use `homebrew`
* Checkout this repository under your `~/.config/nvim`
* Restart `nvim`
